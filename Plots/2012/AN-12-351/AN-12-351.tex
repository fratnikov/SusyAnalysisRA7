We present the procedure used for the combination of background estimates in multilepton channels in the EWKino search. Because multiple groups are providing results in three and four lepton channels using a variety of different techniques, different methods are used to combine different types of backgrounds in each channel. The methods by which the background estimates are obtained are discussed elsewhere.

\section{Introduction}
The search for direct electroweak production of SUSY particles in multilepton modes \cite{CMS-PAS-SUS-12-022} combines search regions with two or more leptons with different requirements on $\MET$, $M_{\rm T}$, dijet mass, lepton pair mass, and others to maximize sensitivity to different types of electroweak production. In the three and four lepton channels, multiple groups have designed and validated a variety of methods to estimate and understand the various contributions to background models. These methods are discussed elsewhere \cite{AN2012:248,AN2012:255,AN2012:256,AN2012:257}. In this note, we restrict ourselves to discussing the procedure for the combination of these estimates in a way that maximizes consistency. We provide justification for assumptions and choices made to accomplish this goal.

\section{Rare Processes}
The background estimates for rare processes are taken from the simulation samples described in Table \ref{tab:rare} by all three groups. Therefore, the estimates from these sources are synchronized and the resulting contributions are used.

\section{Internal Conversion and ZZ}
The authors of \cite{AN2012:248} and \cite{AN2012:256} use separate data-driven methods to estimate the internal conversion background to light leptons and an official production of ZZJets to estimate the ZZ irreducible background. The authors of \cite{AN2012:255} use a private simulation sample that combines the ZZ irreducible background with the internal conversion background. We take the data-driven estimate described in \cite{AN2012:256,AN2012:257} and a synchronized estimate to account for the ZZ irreducible background.

\section{WZ}
WZ production makes up the largest irreducible background for three lepton search regions. The main source of the background estimation comes from the official WZ simulation sample. However, two of the groups apply corrections to make sure that the MET distribution is modeled properly \cite{AN2012:248,AN2012:256}. The data-driven corrections are found to be small and the final result is computed as a simple average of three predictions.

\section{Fake leptons}
The three groups have a variety of ways to estimate the backgrounds from fake leptons (both light leptons and taus). Because one group \cite{AN2012:248} includes the contribution from $\TTbar$ in their data-driven estimate, we average the data-driven contributions summed with the $\TTbar$ simulation contribution used by the two groups in the three lepton channels. Because only two groups \cite{AN2012:255,AN2012:256} are providing the four lepton channels, we synchronize the $\TTbar$ contribution for the four lepton channels and average the data-driven backgrounds.
