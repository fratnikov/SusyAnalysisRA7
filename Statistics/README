These are statistics models used for RA7 analysis.
1. KIT baseline model. RooStats based simplifyed description of RA7 
introducing correlations to intrinsically uncorrelated uncertainties
for different channels. This simplification was shown to marginally affect 
results.
- Model.h/C - the model itself
- main_program.C - the top level steering code
- Chameleon.h/C - configuration parser
- test_60_230_COV.txt - template data file

As this code uses BAT which is not available in CMSSW, no instructions
for how to run this code is available - to be updated.

2. KIT CLs model. The stand-alone code implementing complete
description of RA7 without simplifications to reduce total number
of nuisances.
- ra7StatModel.h/C
- data_outfile_V02.txt, CUDAVISdatafile.txt - measured data files
- mSugra_RUTCOMBO_kFactor_V02.txt, CUDAVISscanfilemSUGRAkfactor.txt - mSUGRA scans
- CONLSP_RUTCOMB_KFactor_V02.txt, CUDAVISscanfileGGMkfactor.txt - GGM scans

To run from the ROOT prompt:
root [1] .L ra7StatModel.C+
root [2] cout << "CLs 95%C.L. UL: " << ra7StatModel::runCLs() << endl;
